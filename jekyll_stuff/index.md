I'm a PhD in the University of Washington math department studying
algebraic geometry. My research focuses on singularities coming from
the minimal model program and moduli of varieties (in particular rational
singularities). Particular points of interest are:
  
- applications of intersection theory and Hodge theory<!-- , in the spirit of -->
  <!-- {% cite chatzistamatiouHigherDirectImages2011 %}, {% cite -->
  <!-- chatzistamatiouHodgeWittCohomologyWittRational2012  %} -->
  
- positive-characteristic behavior

- infinitesimal deformations of MMP singularities<!-- , following {% cite altmannDualizingSheafFirstorder2016 %}. -->
