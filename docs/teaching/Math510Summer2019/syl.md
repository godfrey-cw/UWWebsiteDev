# Objectives

Get really good at solving algebra prelim exam problems.

# Class website

# Grading 

The only expectation is that you present your fair share of problems in
class (we\'ll figure out a sign-up-sheet-system). As long as that
happens, everyone gets a 4.0. 

# Recommended resources 

These are just my personal preferences off the top of my head. If you
are more familiar with an alternative reference, go for it.

-   Lang\'s *Algebra*
-   Serre\'s *Linear representations of finite groups*
-   [Sándor\'s notes on category theory](./Materials/CatThryNotes.pdf) or MacLane\'s
    *Categories for the working mathematician*
-   Reid\'s *Undergraduate commutative algebra* or Atiyah-MacDonald\'s
