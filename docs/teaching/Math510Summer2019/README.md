## Essential information

### Objectives

Get really good at solving algebra prelim exam problems.

### Grading 

The only expectation is that you present some problems in
class (we'll figure out a sign-up-sheet-system). As long as that
happens, everyone gets a 4.0. 

### Recommended resources 

These are just my personal preferences off the top of my head. If you
are more familiar with an alternative reference, feel free to stick
with that &mdash; at this point, the most important thing is being able to
find useful facts quickly.

-   Lang\'s *Algebra*
-   Serre\'s *Linear representations of finite groups*
-   MacLane\'s *Categories for the working mathematician*
-   Reid\'s *Undergraduate commutative algebra*, Atiyah-MacDonald\'s
    *Commutative algebra*, or Eisenbud's *Commutative algebra with a
    view towards algebraic geometry*
-   Weibel\'s *Homological algebra*

Of course, there's always the Internet!
