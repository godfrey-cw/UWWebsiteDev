Old Algebra Prelim Exams 
==============================

# Links 

Prelims of years past (back to 2005) are all [publicly
avaliable](https://math.washington.edu/past-phd-preliminary-exams "UW
prelim exams"). 

Those should provide plenty of practice, but if you are
looking for more problems to work on, there are the following
compilations of exams from the distant past: 

| Compilation                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| [2002-2011](./materials/prelims/0211.pdf) |
| [1990-2001](./materials/prelims/9001.pdf) |
| [1986-1989](./materials/prelims/8689.pdf) |
| [1980-1985](./materials/prelims/8085.pdf) |
| [1976-1979](./materials/prelims/7679.pdf) |
| [1973-1975](./materials/prelims/7375.pdf) |
| [1970-1972](./materials/prelims/7072.pdf) |

# Book form

For convenience all the exams have been compiled into a [single book](./materials/prelims/ocrbook.pdf "book form")
and processed with [optical character
recognition](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "OCRMyPDF") â€”
you can search for "nonabelian groups" all the way back into the
1970s! As such, *please, please* do not print all $\approx$ 200
pages. The mathematics industry already wastes enough paper.
