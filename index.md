I am a PhD student in the University of Washington math department
studying algebraic geometry with [S&aacute;ndor Kov&aacute;cs](http://sites.math.washington.edu/~kovacs/current/index.html).

# Research

My research focuses on birational geometry and singularities. Particular interests include:
  
- singularities of pairs in positive and mixed characteristic
  
- dual complexes of snc varieties and of singularities

- singularities in positive characteristic defined via Frobenius ($F$-singularities)

## Preprints

- [*Higher direct images of logarithmic ideal sheaves*](assets/pdfs/HDILogStructureShf.pdf), in preparation
- [*Thrifty rational resolutions in arbitrary
  characteristic*](assets/pdfs/ThriftyRatl.pdf) (general exam paper)

# Axioms

I believe in [Federico Ardila's](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/)
[axioms](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf):

- **Axiom 1**. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

- **Axiom 2**. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

- **Axiom 3**. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

- **Axiom 4**. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
