I'm a postdoctoral research associate at Pacific Northwest National Lab, working
in the Math of Data Science group with [Henry
Kvinge](https://hkvinge.github.io/) and [Tegan
Emerson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sxRHY7MAAAAJ).

Previously I completed a PhD in mathematics (algebraic geometry) at the University
of Washington, where my advisor was [S&aacute;ndor
Kov&aacute;cs](http://sites.math.washington.edu/~kovacs/current/index.html).

# Research

I am interested in holistic evaluation of deep learning models, including bias,
robustness, explainability and interpretability, and post-hoc analysis of
learned features (e.g. representation (dis)similarity metrics). 
<!-- For the most
part I have worked with computer vision classifiers/segmenters, but more recently I have
experimented with natural language models, of both the generation (GPT) and
understanding (BERT) varieties. -->

My pure math research focused on birational geometry and singularities, mostly in
positive and mixed characteristic.

# Axioms

I believe in [Federico Ardila's](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/)
[axioms](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf):

- **Axiom 1**. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

- **Axiom 2**. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

- **Axiom 3**. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

- **Axiom 4**. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
