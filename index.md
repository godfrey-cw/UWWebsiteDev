I am currently a PhD student in the University of Washington math
department studying algebraic geometry.[test](./test.html)

# Research

My research focuses on singularities coming from
the minimal model program and moduli of varieties, with particular
interests including:
  
- applications of intersection theory and Hodge theory,<!-- , in the spirit of -->
  <!-- {% cite chatzistamatiouHigherDirectImages2011 %}, {% cite -->
  <!-- chatzistamatiouHodgeWittCohomologyWittRational2012  %} -->
  
- positive-characteristic behavior, and

- infinitesimal deformations of MMP singularities 
 <!-- , following {% cite
  altmannDualizingSheafFirstorder2016 %}. -->

# Axioms

I believe in [Federico Ardila's](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/)
[axioms](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf):

- **Axiom 1**. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

- **Axiom 2**. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

- **Axiom 3**. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

- **Axiom 4**. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
