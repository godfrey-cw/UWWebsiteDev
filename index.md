I am currently a PhD student in the University of Washington math
department studying algebraic geometry.

# Research

My research focuses on singularities coming from
the minimal model program and moduli of varieties, with particular
interests including:
  
- applications of intersection theory and Hodge theory,<!-- , in the spirit of -->
  <!-- {% cite chatzistamatiouHigherDirectImages2011 %}, {% cite -->
  <!-- chatzistamatiouHodgeWittCohomologyWittRational2012  %} -->
  
- positive-characteristic behavior, and

- infinitesimal deformations of MMP singularities 
 <!-- , following {% cite
  altmannDualizingSheafFirstorder2016 %}. -->

During the spring of 2019 I was in residence at the Mathematical
Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, supported by the
National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1440140. During the
academic year of 2018-2019 I was supported by the University of
Washington Department of Mathematics Graduate Research Fellowship.
