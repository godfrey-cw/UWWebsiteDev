Its rational homology is identified both with top-weight cohomology of the complex moduli space $M_{g,n}$ and with the homology of a marked version of Kontsevich's graph complex, up to a shift in degrees. We prove a contractibility criterion that applies to various large subspaces. From this we derive a description of the homotopy type of the tropical moduli space for $g = 1$, the top weight cohomology of $M_{1,n}$ as an $S_n$-representation, and additional calculations for small $(g,n)$. We also deduce a vanishing theorem for homology of marked graph complexes from vanishing of cohomology of $M_{g,n}$ in appropriate degrees, and comment on stability phenomena, or lack thereof.},

This introductory textbook in algebraic topology is suitable for use in a course or for self-study, featuring broad coverage of the subject and a readable exposition, with many examples and exercises. The four main chapters present the basic material of the subject: fundamental group and covering spaces, homology and cohomology, higher homotopy groups, and homotopy theory generally. The author emphasizes the geometric aspects of the subject, which helps students gain intuition. A unique feature of the book is the inclusion of many optional topics which are not usually part of a first course due to time constraints, and for which elementary expositions are sometimes hard to find. Among these are: Bockstein and transfer homomorphisms, direct and inverse limits, H-spaces and Hopf algebras, the Brown representability theorem, the James reduced product, the Dold-Thom theorem, and a full exposition of Steenrod squares and powers. Researchers will also welcome this aspect of the book. ' from publisher's description.},

A folklore conjecture predicts that the dual complex of D is homeomorphic to the quotient of a sphere by a finite group. The main result of the paper shows that the fundamental group of the dual complex of D is a quotient of the fundamental group of the smooth locus of X , hence its pro-finite completion is finite. This leads to a positive answer in dimension $$\le $$ ≤ 4. We also study the dual complex of degenerations of Calabi–Yau varieties. The key technical result we prove is that, after a volume preserving birational equivalence, the transform of D supports an ample divisor.},

This kind of problem occurs in mathematical physics, dynamic systems, and mechanical engineering.

In the last section we describe the local structure of these moduli stacks in terms of toric stacks. Nous construisons des champs algébriques classifiant les structures logarithmiques et donnons de nouvelles interprétations, fondées sur la théorie des champs, des concepts de morphisme log plat, log lisse, et log étale introduits par K. Kato. Dans la dernière partie, nous décrivons la structure locale de ces champs en termes de champs toriques.},

	abstract = {This book is an introduction to the theory of algebraic spaces and stacks intended for graduate students and researchers familiar with algebraic geometry at the level of a first-year graduate course. The first several chapters are devoted to background material including chapters on Grothendieck topologies, descent, and fibered categories. Following this, the theory of algebraic spaces and stacks is developed. The last three chapters discuss more advanced topics including the Keel-Mori theorem on the existence of coarse moduli spaces, gerbes and Brauer groups, and various moduli stacks of curves.},
