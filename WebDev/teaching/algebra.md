# Office hours

TBD. Please fill out the **Doodle poll** (if you didn't receive it via
email, let me know) if you have not already done so.

# Homework and grading

All homework will be posted, uploaded and graded on
[Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1322637). As stated in the on
the Assignments page, please write your solutions  \\(\LaTeX \\) and
upload a `.pdf`. 

## \\( \LaTeX \\) resources 

If you are relatively new to \\( \LaTeX \\) I highly recommend the
[WikiBook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX). The documentation on
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) is also quite helpful. 

# Grading concerns

If you have a concern about the way your assignment was graded, or
would like more feedback about your solution, please contact me via
email or stop by office hours as soon as possible.
