Trifocal Grassmann tensors, related to three projections from a projective space of dimension k onto view-spaces of varying dimensions are studied in this work. A canonical form for the combined projection matrices is obtained. When the centers of projections satisfy a natural generality assumption, such canonical form gives a closed formula for the rank of trifocal Grassmann tensors. The same approach is also applied to the case of two projections, confirming a previous result obtained with different methods in [6]. The rank of sequences of tensors converging to tensors associated with degenerate configurations of projection centers is also considered, giving concrete examples of a wide spectrum of phenomena that can happen.},

Here, we consider the closely related problem of the 28 bitangents to a smooth plane quartic. However, it turns out the relevant vector bundle is not relatively orientable and new ideas are needed to produce enriched counts. We introduce a fixed ``line at infinity,'' which leads to enriched counts of bitangents that depend on their geometry relative to the quartic and this distinguished line.},

To classify the emergent collective motion in a large library of numerical simulations and to recover model parameters from the simulation data, we apply machine learning techniques to two different types of input. First, we input time series of order parameters traditionally used in studies of collective motion. Second, we input measures based in topology that summarize the time-varying persistent homology of simulation data over multiple scales. This topological approach does not require prior knowledge of the expected patterns.

Although the statement involves only elementary algebraic geometry, our proof employs Berkovich non-archimedean analytic methods. We construct the structure constants of the algebra via counting non-archimedean analytic disks in the analytification of U . We establish various properties of the counting, notably deformation invariance, symmetry, gluing formula and convexity. In the special case when U is a Fock-Goncharov skew-symmetric X-cluster variety, we prove that our algebra generalizes, and in particular gives a direct geometric construction of, the mirror algebra of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich.},

By examining the topology of small regions around each point, one can optimally stratify a given dataset into clusters, each of which is in turn well-approximable by a suitable submanifold of the ambient space. Since these approximating submanifolds might have different dimensions, we are able to detect non-manifold like singular regions in data even when none of the data points have been sampled from those singularities. We showcase this method by identifying the intersection of two surfaces in the 24-dimensional space of cyclo-octane conformations, and by locating all the self-intersections of a Henneberg minimal surface immersed in 3-dimensional space. Due to the local nature of the required topological computations, the algorithmic burden of performing such data stratification is readily distributable across several processors.},

Specifically, in analogy with the so-called Hassett-Keel program for the moduli space of curves, we study the variation of log canonical models for locally symmetric varieties of Type IV associated to D lattices. In particular, for the dimension 19 case, we conjecturally obtain a continuous one-parameter interpolation (via a directed MMP) between the GIT and Baily-Borel compactifications for the moduli of degree 4 K3 surfaces.

Our results provide evidence for a strengthening of the direct summand theorem, namely that regular maps preserve the splinter property.},

  title = {On the {{Riemannian}} Barycentre of a {{Markov}} Chain},
  abstract = {The Riemannian barycentre is one of the most widely used statistical descriptors for probability distributions on Riemannian manifolds. At present, existing algorithms are able to compute the Riemannian barycentre of a probability distribution, only if i.i.d. samples of this distribution are readily available. However, there are many cases where i.i.d. samples are quite difficult to obtain, and have to be replaced with non-independent samples, generated by a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. To overcome this difficulty, the present paper proposes a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for computing the Riemannian barycentre of a probability distribution on a Hadamard manifold (a simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold with non-positive curvature). This algorithm relies on two original propositions, proved in the paper. The first proposition states that the recursive barycentre of samples generated from a geometrically ergodic Markov chain converges in the mean-square to the Riemannian barycentre of the stationary distribution of this chain. The second proposition provides verifiable conditions which ensure a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain, with its values in a symmetric Hadamard manifold, is geometrically ergodic. This latter result yields a partial solution, in the context of Riemannian manifolds, to the problem of geometric ergodicity of Metropolis-Hastings chains, which has previously attracted extensive attention when considered in Euclidean space. In addition to these two propositions, the new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, proposed in this paper, is applied to a problem of Bayesian inference, arising from computer vision.},

We prove that the resulting decomposition is the unique minimal stratification for which the strata are homogeneous and the given sheaf is constructible. In particular, when we choose to work with the local homology sheaf, our algorithm gives an alternative to the local homology transfer algorithm given in Bendich et al. (2012), and the cohomology stratification algorithm given in Nanda (2017). Additionally, we give examples of stratifications based on the geometric techniques of Breiding et al. (2018), illustrating how the sheaf-theoretic approach can be used to study stratifications from both topological and geometric perspectives. This approach also points toward future applications of sheaf theory in the study of topological data analysis by illustrating the utility of the language of sheaf theory in generalizing existing algorithms.},

We show that the most interesting part, corresponding to regular conjugacy classes, is nothing but a sum over a finite-dimensional vector space over the global field, which we call the Steinberg-Hitchin base. Therefore it may be analyzed using the Poisson summation formula. Our main result is that the leading term of the dual sum (the value at 0) is precisely the dominant term of the trace formula (the contribution of the trivial representation). This gives us hope that the full Poisson summation formula would reveal the patterns predicted by functoriality.},

  abstract = {We define a theory of {\'e}tale motives over a noetherian scheme. This provides a system of categories of complexes of motivic sheaves with integral coefficients which is closed under the six operations of Grothendieck. The rational part of these categories coincides with the triangulated categories of Beilinson motives (and is thus strongly related to algebraic K -theory). We extend the rigidity theorem of Suslin and Voevodsky over a general base scheme. This can be reformulated by saying that torsion {\'e}tale motives essentially coincide with the usual complexes of torsion {\'e}tale sheaves (at least if we restrict ourselves to torsion prime to the residue characteristics). As a consequence, we obtain the expected results of absolute purity, of finiteness, and of Grothendieck duality for {\'e}tale motives with integral coefficients, by putting together their counterparts for Beilinson motives and for torsion {\'e}tale sheaves. Following Thomason's insights, this also provides a conceptual and convenient construction of the {$\mathscr{l}$}-adic realization of motives, as the homotopy {$\mathscr{l}$}-completion functor.},

We show that its Hochschild homology theory coincides with the theory of log-forms on X with logarithmic structure induced by D, and in particular, that the noncommutative Hodge-to de Rham sequence on Qcohlog(U, X, D) recovers known log Hodge structure on the de Rham cohomology of the open variety U . As an application, we compute the Hochschild homology of the category of coherent sheaves on the infinite root stack of Talpo and Vistoli in the toroidal setting. We prove a derived invariance result for this theory: namely, that strictly toroidal changes of compactification do not change the derived category of Qcohlog(U, X, D).

Finally, for a log scheme not necessarily over C, another natural candidate is the profinite \textasciiacute{}etale homotopy type of its infinite root stack. We prove that, for a fine saturated log scheme locally of finite type over C, these three notions agree. In particular, we construct a comparison map from the Kato-Nakayama space to the underlying topological stack of the infinite root stack, and prove that it induces an equivalence on profinite completions.

Our presentation of black-box optimization, strongly influenced by Nesterov's seminal book and Nemirovski's lecture notes, includes the analysis of cutting plane methods, as well as (accelerated) gradient descent schemes. We also pay special attention to non-Euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging) and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA (to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term), saddle-point mirror prox (Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing), and a concise description of interior point methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss stochastic gradient descent, mini-batches, random coordinate descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.},

Mathematically, a multi-armed bandit is defined by the payoff process associated with each option. In this monograph, we focus on two extreme cases in which the analysis of regret is particularly simple and elegant: i.i.d. payoffs and adversarial payoffs. Besides the basic setting of finitely many actions, we also analyze some of the most important variants and extensions, such as the contextual bandit model.},

Whereas the achievable limit in terms of regret minimization is now well known, our aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the performance in terms of identifying the m best arms. We introduce generic notions of complexity for the two dominant frameworks considered in the literature: fixed-budget and fixed-confidence settings. In the fixed-confidence setting, we provide the first known distribution-dependent lower bound on the complexity that involves information-theoretic quantities and holds when m {$\geq$} 1 under general assumptions. In the specific case of two armed-bandits, we derive refined lower bounds in both the fixedconfidence and fixed-budget settings, along with matching algorithms for Gaussian and Bernoulli bandit models. These results show in particular that the complexity of the fixed-budget setting may be smaller than the complexity of the fixed-confidence setting, contradicting the familiar behavior observed when testing fully specified alternatives. In addition, we also provide improved sequential stopping rules that have guaranteed error probabilities and shorter average running times. The proofs rely on two technical results that are of independent interest : a deviation lemma for self-normalized sums (Lemma 7) and a novel change of measure inequality for bandit models (Lemma 1).},

To do so we introduce three new ideas in the derivative-free optimization literature: (i) kernel methods, (ii) a generalization of Bernoulli convolutions, and (iii) a new annealing schedule for exponential weights (with increasing learning rate). The basic version of our algorithm achieves \$\textbackslash{}tilde\{O\}(n\^\{9.5\} \textbackslash{}sqrt\{T\})\$-regret, and we show that a simple variant of this algorithm can be run in \$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{poly\}(n \textbackslash{}log(T))\$-time per step at the cost of an additional \$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{poly\}(n) T\^\{o(1)\}\$ factor in the regret. These results improve upon the \$\textbackslash{}tilde\{O\}(n\^\{11\} \textbackslash{}sqrt\{T\})\$-regret and \$\textbackslash{}exp(\textbackslash{}mathrm\{poly\}(T))\$-time result of the first two authors, and the \$\textbackslash{}log(T)\^\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{poly\}(n)\} \textbackslash{}sqrt\{T\}\$-regret and \$\textbackslash{}log(T)\^\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{poly\}(n)\}\$-time result of Hazan and Li. Furthermore we conjecture that another variant of the algorithm could achieve \$\textbackslash{}tilde\{O\}(n\^\{1.5\} \textbackslash{}sqrt\{T\})\$-regret, and moreover that this regret is unimprovable (the current best lower bound being \$\textbackslash{}Omega(n \textbackslash{}sqrt\{T\})\$ and it is achieved with linear functions). For the simpler situation of zeroth order stochastic convex optimization this corresponds to the conjecture that the optimal query complexity is of order \$n\^3 / \textbackslash{}epsilon\^2\$.},

  abstract = {In a series of recent theoretical works, it was shown that strongly over-parameterized neural networks trained with gradient-based methods could converge exponentially fast to zero training loss, with their parameters hardly varying. In this work, we show that this ``lazy training'' phenomenon is not specific to over-parameterized neural networks, and is due to a choice of scaling, often implicit, that makes the model behave as its linearization around the initialization, thus yielding a model equivalent to learning with positive-definite kernels. Through a theoretical analysis, we exhibit various situations where this phenomenon arises in non-convex optimization and we provide bounds on the distance between the lazy and linearized optimization paths. Our numerical experiments bring a critical note, as we observe that the performance of commonly used non-linear deep convolutional neural networks in computer vision degrades when trained in the lazy regime. This makes it unlikely that ``lazy training'' is behind the many successes of neural networks in difficult high dimensional tasks.},

In this paper we take a step towards understanding the best attainable regret bounds for BCO: we give an efficient and near-optimal regret algorithm for BCO with strongly-convex and smooth loss functions. In contrast to previous works on BCO that use time invariant exploration schemes, our method employs an exploration scheme that shrinks with time.},

This includes sparse spikes deconvolution or training a neural network with a single hidden layer. For these problems, we study a simple minimization method: the unknown measure is discretized into a mixture of particles and a continuous-time gradient descent is performed on their weights and positions. This is an idealization of the usual way to train neural networks with a large hidden layer. We show that, when initialized correctly and in the many-particle limit, this gradient flow, although non-convex, converges to global minimizers. The proof involves Wasserstein gradient flows, a by-product of optimal transport theory. Numerical experiments show that this asymptotic behavior is already at play for a reasonable number of particles, even in high dimension.},

  abstract = {Neural networks, a central tool in machine learning, have demonstrated remarkable, high fidelity performance on image recognition and classification tasks. These successes evince an ability to accurately represent high dimensional functions, but rigorous results about the approximation error of neural networks after training are few. Here we establish conditions for global convergence of the standard optimization algorithm used in machine learning applications, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and quantify the scaling of its error with the size of the network. This is done by reinterpreting SGD as the evolution of a particle system with interactions governed by a potential related to the objective or ``loss'' function used to train the network. We show that, when the number n of units is large, the empirical distribution of the particles descends on a convex landscape towards the global minimum at a rate independent of n, with a resulting approximation error that universally scales as O(n-1). These properties are established in the form of a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the empirical distribution. Our analysis also quantifies the scale and nature of the noise introduced by SGD and provides guidelines for the step size and batch size to use when training a neural network. We illustrate our findings on examples in which we train neural networks to learn the energy function of the continuous 3-spin model on the sphere. The approximation error scales as our analysis predicts in as high a dimension as d = 25.},

We extend this to a functorial family of objects corresponding to elliptic curves with level structure and modular forms on them. Along the way, we produce a natural way to restrict to the cusps, providing multiplicative maps from Tmf with level structure to forms of K -theory. In particular, this allows us to construct a connective spectrum tmf0(3) consistent with properties suggested by Mahowald and Rezk. This is accomplished using the machinery of logarithmic structures. We construct a presheaf of locally even-periodic elliptic cohomology theories, equipped with highly structured multiplication, on the log-{\'e}tale site of the moduli of elliptic curves. Evaluating this presheaf on modular curves produces Tmf with level structure.},

It follows that Barwick's theorem of the heart holds for nonconnective K-theory spectra when the heart is noetherian. We give several applications. On the one hand, we prove the vanishing results for the negative K-groups of a large class of dg algebras. On the other, we prove that various localization sequences `a la Blumberg-Mandell and Barwick-Lawson hold in nonconnective K-theory.

For a reductive group action on a smooth, compact, polarized variety (X, L), the cohomologies of L over the GIT quotient X//G equal the invariant part of the cohomologies over X. This generalizes the theorem of [GS] on global sections, and strengthens its subsequent extensions ([JK], [M]) to RiemannRoch numbers. Remarkable by-products are the invariance of cohomology of vector bundles over X//G under a small change in the defining polarization or under shift desingularization, as well as a new proof of Boutot's theorem. Also studied are equivariant holomorphic forms and the equivariant Hodgeto-de Rham spectral sequences for X and its strata, whose collapse is shown. One application is a new proof of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem of [T1] for the moduli stack of G-bundles over a curve, and of analogous statements for the moduli stacks and spaces of bundles with parabolic structures. Collapse of the Hodge-to-de Rham sequences for these stacks is also shown.},

  title = {{{NOTES ON DERIVED FUNCTORS}}},
  abstract = {This is a polished version of notes begun in the late 1980s, largely available from my home page since then, meant to be accessible to mid-level graduate students. The first three chapters treat the basics of derived categories and functors, and of the rich formalism, over ringed spaces, of the derived functors, for unbounded complexes, of the sheaf functors {$\otimes$}, Hom, f{${_\ast}$} and f {${_\ast}$} (where f is a ringed-space map). Included are some enhancements, for concentrated (= quasi-compact and quasi-separated) schemes, of classical results such as the projection and Ku\textasciidieresis{}nneth isomorphisms. The fourth chapter presents the abstract foundations of Grothendieck Duality\textemdash{}existence and torindependent base change for the right adjoint of the derived functor Rf{${_\ast}$} when f is a quasi-proper map of concentrated schemes, the twisted inverse image pseudofunctor for separated finite-type maps of noetherian schemes, some refinements for maps of finite tor-dimension, and a brief discussion of dualizing complexes.},

It introduces basic examples of partial differential equations, arising in continuum mechanics, electromagnetism, complex analysis and other areas, and develops a number of tools for their solution, including particularly Fourier analysis, distribution theory, and Sobolev spaces. These tools are applied to the treatment of basic problems in linear PDE, including the Laplace equation, heat equation, and wave equation, as well as more general elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. Companion texts, which take the theory of partial differential equations further, are AMS volume 116, treating more advanced topics in linear PDE, and AMS volume 117, treating problems in nonlinear PDE. --},

In this new book, Robin Hartshorne studies first what happens over small infinitesimal deformations, and then gradually builds up to more global situations, using methods pioneered by Kodaira and Spencer in the complex analytic case, and adapted and expanded in algebraic geometry by Grothendieck. Topics include: deformations over the dual numbers; smoothness and the infinitesimal lifting property; Zariski tangent space and obstructions to deformation problems; pro-representable functors of Schlessinger; infinitesimal study of moduli spaces such as the Hilbert scheme, Picard scheme, moduli of curves, and moduli of stable vector bundles. The author includes numerous exercises, as well as important examples illustrating various aspects of the theory.

  abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.``Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.''\textemdash{}Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

This introductory textbook in algebraic topology is suitable for use in a course or for self-study, featuring broad coverage of the subject and a readable exposition, with many examples and exercises. The four main chapters present the basic material of the subject: fundamental group and covering spaces, homology and cohomology, higher homotopy groups, and homotopy theory generally. The author emphasizes the geometric aspects of the subject, which helps students gain intuition. A unique feature of the book is the inclusion of many optional topics which are not usually part of a first course due to time constraints, and for which elementary expositions are sometimes hard to find. Among these are: Bockstein and transfer homomorphisms, direct and inverse limits, H-spaces and Hopf algebras, the Brown representability theorem, the James reduced product, the Dold-Thom theorem, and a full exposition of Steenrod squares and powers. Researchers will also welcome this aspect of the book. ' from publisher's description.},

This leads to a positive answer in dimension {$\leq$} {$\leq$} 4. We also study the dual complex of degenerations of Calabi\textendash{}Yau varieties.

The second part of the book investigates the meaning of these results in several directions. The book is is completely self-contained and can be used by students, while its content gives an up-to-date account of Hodge theory and complex algebraic geometry as has been developed by P.

With this approach, students gain an appreciation for how mathematical structures and their interplay lead to powerful results and insights in a number of different settings.  The text is designed for a full-year introduction to abstract algebra at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level, but contains substantially more material than would normally be covered in one year. Portions of the book may also be used for various one-semester topics courses in advanced algebra, each of which would provide a solid background for a follow-up course delving more deeply into one of many possible areas: algebraic number theory, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, Lie groups, etc.},

The critical locus carries a perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles. Our main result shows that one obtains the interchange of Hodge numbers expected in mirror symmetry. This exchange is between the Hodge numbers of the hypersurface and certain Hodge numbers defined using a mixed Hodge structure on the hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf.},

First published in 1953 (revised 1964, 1976), "Principles of Mathematical Analysis" has become a classic introduction to the field.  Generations of students have become acquainted with this slim, blue-covered volume (fondly referred to as "Baby Rudin"), which continues to be used for honours courses at the top mathematics departments in the US.  "Principles of Mathematical Analysis" has also been influential internationally through translated editions in Russian, German, French, and Chinese, among others.

Walter B. Rudin (1921-2010) was an Austrian-American mathematician and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1959-1991).  He was known for his contributions to complex and harmonic analysis and authorship of several widely adopted textbooks, including "Principles of Mathematical Analysis", "Real and Complex Analysis", and "Functional Analysis".},

We develop the theory of logarithmic de Rham complexes, the use of the corresponding spectral sequence, lifting properties for manifolds and their Frobenius morphisms in characteristic p{$>$}0 and the proof of the degeneration of the Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence with algebraic methods, due to P. Deligne and L. Illusie. We apply those methods to obtain vanishing theorems. Several typical applications and the generic theorems of M. Green and R. Lazarsfeld complete the picture. This exposition is self-contained and accessible to anyone with background in modern algebraic geometry. The necessary formalisms from cohomology theory are recalled in an appendix. Contents: Introduction Kodaira's vanishing theorem, a general discussion Logarithmic de Rham complexes Integral parts of Q-divisors and coverings Vanishing theorems, the formal set-up Vanishing theorems for invertible sheaves Differential forms and higher direct images Some applications of vanishing theorems Characteristic p methods: Lifting of schemes The Frobenius and its liftings The proof of Deligne and Illusie Vanishing theorems in characteristic p.

The subgroup is generated by reflexions, and may be the direct product of one or more factors (all the primes of symmetry in one factor being perpendicular to all those in any other factor).

  abstract = {This is a systematic study of the behaviour of finite coverings of (affine) schemes with regard to two Grothendieck topologies: the canonical topology and the fpqc topology. The history of the problem takes roots in the foundations of Grothendieck topologies, passes through main strides in Commutative Algebra and leads to new Mathematics up to perfectoids and prisms. We first review the canonical topology of affine schemes and show, keeping with Olivier's lost work, that it coincides with the effective descent topology; covering maps are given by universally injective ring maps, which we discuss in detail. We then give a "catalogue raisonn\textbackslash{}'e" of examples of finite coverings which separate the canonical, fpqc and fppf topologies. The key result is that finite coverings of regular schemes are coverings for the canonical topology, and even for the fpqc topology (but not necessarily for the fppf topology). We discuss a "weakly functorial" aspect of this result. "Splinters" are those affine Noetherian schemes for which every finite covering is a covering for the canonical topology. We also investigate their mysterious fpqc analogs, and prove that in prime characteristic, they are all regular. We also show that (non-necessarily flat) morphisms \$f\$ of affine Noetherian schemes which are coverings for the fpqc topology descend regularity, at least if \$f\$ is finite, or in positive characteristic.},
